1.) What is the definition of server port?
A server port is a specific location on a server where it listens for incoming 
connections from clients. It is identified by a numerical value and associated 
with a specific process or service.

2.) What is server port range?
The server port range is from 0 to 65535. The ports are divided into three categories,
The first 1023 ports are Well-known ports are assigned to common services and protocols.
Second, from ports 1024 to 49151 are registered ports they are not assigned to specific services
but they are available for any use by applications. Lastly, the ports from 49151 to 65535
are private/dynamic ports, these ports are used for client side connections.
 
3.) How many bits does number above represent?
since the port range is from 0 to 65535, it requires 16bits to represent a port number 
because 2^16 is equal to 65536 which is sufficient to cover all possible port numbers

4.) State 10 common server ports
20 (FTP Data), 21 (FTP Control), 22 (SSH), 23 (Telnet),
25 (SMTP), 53 (DNS), 80 (HTTP), 110 (POP3), 443 (HTTPS), 465 (SMTPS).
