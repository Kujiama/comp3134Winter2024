Preventing Directory traversal:
- Use basename() on the input to strip out any directory traversal attempts, ensuring only the last component of the path is used
- check if directory is valid and within the current directory


File Existence and Type
- Use file_exists() and is_dir() to verify that the requested path points to an existing directory.
- if the input contains a dot, reject to prevent file listings.
